# 100 days of Vanilla

A collection of small, focused projects built during a 100 Days of Code challenge using only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, no libraries.

## Goal
Practice and improve core web fundamentals by building 20 small projects in the course of 100 days.

## Principles
- Pure vanilla: only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- No frameworks, no build tools, no external UI libraries.
- Emphasize readability, accessibility, and progressive enhancement.
- Keep projects small, self-contained, and well-documented.


## Contributing
- Suggestions and issues welcome. Open an issue for bugs or ideas.

## License

Happy hacking — keep it simple, learn the fundamentals, and enjoy building with vanilla web technologies.
